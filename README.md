This is data taken from a "[Whose Heritage? Public Symbols of the Confederacy](https://www.splcenter.org/20160421/whose-heritage-public-symbols-confederacy)" report from April 21, 2016.

I could not find a machine-readable format of the data online, so I:

1. Opened the PDF
2. Highlighted the text in tables and exported it to CSV
3. Ran reader.rb in this repository to clean up the CSV data
4. Exported the data back into YAML files

With this data you can create graphs to analyze how much coverage in your city is taken up by these structures or generate maps that navigate you through an unfamiliar part of your state in order to tear them down. Whatever you want! It's up to you.

For posterity, the PDF from which this data was collected is available in this repository as well.
